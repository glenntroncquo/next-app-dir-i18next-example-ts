  "faq3Answer": "Yes, our Brazilian keratin treatment is safe for colored, highlighted, and chemically-treated hair. In fact, it can help seal and protect your color while adding shine and reducing fading.",

  "faq4Answer": "No, our professional keratin treatment actually strengthens and repairs damaged hair. We use formaldehyde-free formulas that are gentle yet effective, focusing on hair health and integrity.",
